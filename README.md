# GitHub Followers - Frontend

This project was a coding exercise for an interview.

This is a simple React app that displays all the GitHub followers of  [Mosh Hamedani](https://programmingwithmosh.com/).


The purpose of the client is to develop with React, style it with Ant Design and display the data fetched from the server, all done without using create-react-app but using webpack instead.

The purpose of the server is to create the express server that fetches the data of the GitHub followers of Mosh Hamedani and serve it to the frontend app.
